Issues:
After the final object is picked up, the completion spawn script is

Looking at your BulletCollision.cs code, I identified an important issue: You're
destroying targets by looking for them in the Hierarchy using GameObject.Find.
That means the first one that returns will be used; if you hit the left target
first, the right one is destroyed instead. If more targets are added to the 
scene, the problem will make the game unplayable. To fix it, in OnCollisionEnter,
use Destroy(collision.gameObject).
